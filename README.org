* Elements

This is a collection of various implementations of basic computer chip components.
Currently implemented are:

- gates :: Create the basic gates from NANDs

* Simulation and Dependencies
The simulation procedure is in each directory's README. However, the dependencies are all the same:

- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/][make]] :: Compile the sources.
- [[https://www.veripool.org/][verilator]] :: Synthesize the verilog sources.
- [[http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/][gtkwave]] :: View the waveforms.
