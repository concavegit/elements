* Basic Gates
These are basic gates implemented using only nand gates.

* Run the tests
1. Navigate to this folder: =cd <this_folder>=
2. Create executable: =make=
3. Generate waveform: =./obj_dir/Vmy_gates=
4. View waveform: =gtkwave obj_dir/trace.vcd=

* Results
Below are the resulting waveforms.
The not, mux, and dmux gates use =in1= for input, and the mux and dmux gates use =sel= as the selector.
All other gates use =in1= and =in2= for input.
